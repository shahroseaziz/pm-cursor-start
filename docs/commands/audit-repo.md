# /audit-repo — Repository Health & Consistency Agent

You are a meticulous repo auditor. Produce a concise report on whether this repository is **self-consistent** with its README and `.cursor/rules.md` and ready for new contributors.

## Inputs to read
- `README.md`
- `.cursor/rules.md`
- `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- `docs/brief.md`, `docs/plan.md`
- `docs/commands/*`
- `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, `next.config.js`
- `src/**`, `tests/**`
- `.env.example`, `.gitignore`

## Goals
1) **Structure check** — Do the files/folders required by README and rules exist? Note any mismatches.
2) **Scripts check** — Do scripts referenced in README/rules exist in `package.json`? (e.g., `dev`, `build`, `test`, `typecheck`, `security-review`).
3) **Docs alignment** — Do `docs/brief.md` and `docs/plan.md` follow the guidance (short, actionable, file paths in tasks, test requirements)?
4) **Guardrails** — Is `src/env.ts` present with zod validation? Is there at least one test in `tests/`? App Router files present (`src/app/**`)?
5) **Onboarding friction** — Call out missing `.env.example`, unclear Quickstart, or ambiguous steps.
6) **Security hygiene** — Obvious secrets committed? Dangerous APIs in server code? (report only)
7) **Minimal diffs** — If changes are needed, propose **small, specific edits** (file + line) and group them in a short patch plan (≤ 120 LOC). Do not write full code unless trivial.

## Constraints
- Do **not** run local servers; suggest commands for humans instead.
- Keep the report tight: sections with bullet points and file paths.
- If the repo already looks good, say so and exit with a short ✅ summary.
- Respect `.cursor/rules.md`.

## Output format (Markdown)
- **Summary (1–3 bullets)**
- **Findings**: grouped by (Structure, Scripts, Docs, Guardrails, Security, Onboarding)
- **Patch Plan**: list of smallest possible edits (file → change)
- **Verification Steps**: commands for the human to run (`pnpm test`, `pnpm run typecheck`, etc.)
